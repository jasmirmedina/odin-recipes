  <h1>Touchdown Pizza</h1>

  <p>
    My favorite sports pub serves this, and I've come up with a simple and delicious home version.<br>
    Many local restaurants sell wing sauce, and most grocery stores carry it near the steak and BBQ sauces.<br>
    It's rich, so serve in squares as an appetizer. Serve ranch dressing, celery, and carrot sticks on the side.<br>
    Enjoy!
