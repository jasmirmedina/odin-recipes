  <h1>Ramp Omelet</h1>

  <p>
    This is a quick and easy omelet that I make every year when ramps are in season.<br>
    I usually serve it on a slice of buttered bread. Use as little or as much ramps as you like.

  <h2>Ingredients:</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>2 large eggs</li>
    <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons grated Cheddar cheese, or to taste</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons ramps - leaves washed, dried, and finely chopped</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Directions:</h2>

  <p><strong>Step 1</strong></p>
  <p>
    Combine eggs, salt, and pepper in a bowl and whisk until foamy.<br>
    Mix in Cheddar cheese and ramps.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Step 2</strong></p>
  <p>
    Melt butter in a small skillet over medium-low heat. Pour in egg mixture and let cook for 30 seconds.<br>
    Lift the edges of the omelet so that the uncooked egg runs under the cooked edges and comes<br>
    into contact with the hot skillet. Shake and tilt the skillet to move the uncooked egg.<br>
    Repeat until the top is set, about 5 minutes. Flip and cook on the other side until lightly browned,<br>
    about 2 minutes.
