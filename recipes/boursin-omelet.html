  <h2>Ingredients:</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>3 large eggs</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon water</li>
    <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon minced fresh chives</li>
    <li>1 ounce soft French cheese, such as BoursinÂ® cheese (any flavor), crumbled</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Directions:</h2>

  <p><strong>Step 1</strong></p>
  <p>
    Whisk eggs, water, salt, and pepper together in a bowl until yolks and whites are<br>
    completely combined and eggs are light and frothy, about 30 seconds.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Step 2</strong></p>
  <p>
    Melt butter in an 8-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat.<br>
    Pour eggs into skillet and stir rapidly for 20 to 30 seconds until eggs are just starting to set.<br>
    Spread top of eggs in an even layer and let cook until just slightly underdone and shiny. If necessary,<br>
    move extra raw egg around to the edges of the skillet. Lower heat to medium-low to prevent browning,<br>
    if necessary.<br>
  </p>

  <p><strong>Step 3</strong></p>
  <p>
    Sprinkle cheese down the middle of the omelet, along with 2 teaspoons chives.<br>
    Fold one side over the cheese in the middle, followed by the other side,<br>
    so the omelet is folded in thirds. Remove to a plate and sprinkle with remaining chives.<br>
